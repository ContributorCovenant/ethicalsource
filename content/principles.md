The practice of Ethical Source is informed by these principles:

1. **Our work benefits the commons.** We release our software under conditions that do not prohibit modification, derivative works, and similar use and reuse in the general spirit of free, open source, source available, or other commons distribution.
2. **Our work is done in the open.** We make our source code publicly available, develop and maintain it in public view, and welcome  public contributions.
3. **Our community strives to be welcoming and just.** We have clear and documented rules for governance, and we consistently and fairly enforce a comprehensive code of conduct.
4. **Our work puts accessibility first.** We design our software to be accessible, ensuring that all features and functionality are available to all users, including users who may rely on assistive devices.
5. **Our work prioritizes user safety.** We design our software with features and safeguards to minimize the risk of abuse or harm to others through the its use or misuse.
6. **Our work protects user privacy.** We design our software with controls for the complete deletion of any personal data gathered from its use, and for exporting any such data to the end-user on request in a human-readable or interoperable and open format.
7. **Our work deserves support.** We are empowered to request remuneration in the form of code contributions, financial contributions, or other forms of voluntary support from organizations that derive commercial value from our software.

We measure our success in adhering to these principles on _impact_ rather than _intent_.
